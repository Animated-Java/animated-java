# Ideas for 1.20.2
- Create an NBT list of all summoned AnimatedJava root entity UUIDs and use those instead of using @e selectors to select them. It's 70x faster
- Remove the need for a scoreboard tree for selecting/applying next frame of animation. Using macros should make this easy.
- Remove scoreboard arguments in favor of function arguments.
