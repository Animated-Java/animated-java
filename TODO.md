- [ ] Custom animation properties dialog
- [ ] Add root NBT blueprint setting
- [ ] Prevent the user setting their export namespace to 'global' or 'minecraft'

# Data Pack
- [ ] When merging the new minecraft:tick tag with old one, try and find any old style function references (AKA animated_java:my_project/zzzzzz/tick), and remove them.
- [ ] Animation Tweening
- [ ] Look into automatically updating "outdated" rigs when the data pack is reloaded and a new version of the rig is present. Maybe only resummon the bones of the rig, and apply summon nbt to the root?
