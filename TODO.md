    - [ ] Three global options
        - [ ] This animation controls all bones in the model
        - [ ] This animation resets all bones to it's default pose when played, but then acts like option 3
        - [ ] This animation controls only bones it actually animates
    - [ ] And 3 bone config options
        - [ ] Use global setting
        - [ ] This bone resets every time an animation is started via the play function
        - [ ] This bone is not animated by any animations
